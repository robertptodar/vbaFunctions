# VBA-Functions
Functions I have created that could be helpful for others to use. 

Example Funtion:

```VB
'=========================================================================
' WAY OF CREATING A STRING USING THE WAY C# & JS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES DO
' EXAMPLE:
'   myString("This {0} a test of\n {1} Function", Array("is", "myString"))
' RESULT:
'   "This is a test of" & vbnewline & "myString Function"
'=========================================================================
Public Function myString(Original As String, Optional Arr As Variant) As String
    
    Dim I As Integer
    
    'SPECIAL CHARACTERS TO MAKE NEWLINES\TABS EASIER
    Original = Replace(Original, "\n", vbNewLine)
    Original = Replace(Original, "\t", vbTab)
    
    'REPLACE WITH ARRAYS
    If IsArray(Arr) Then
        For I = LBound(Arr, 1) To UBound(Arr, 1)
            Original = Replace(Original, "{" & I & "}", Arr(I))
        Next I
     End If
    myString = Original

End Function
